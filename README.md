marbles: class Marble:
            color ------- *string[rand() % 2] {red,green,blue}  (should be %3)
            number ------- 1 + rand() % 99 (just %100)
        
        
bag: something like list[] in py
            can create a pointer for saving the class, but forget how to remove the ball without bugging.
